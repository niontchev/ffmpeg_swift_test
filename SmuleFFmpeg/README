SmuleFFmpeg is a test program integrating ffmpeg library, sound effect processing and audio toolbox playback

There should be nothing to setup except the developing team signature in Signing & Capabilities

There are two targets iOS-Simulator and macOS working identically.

How to use the application:

1. Run the project and select one of the two files included as resources
2. Push the <Decode> button
3. Now you can play the file with the multi-tap delay effect as an audio filter


This was a day and a half project and the multi-tap delay parameters are not displayed nicely to the user.
Here are the ranges:

Delay: 			0 to 5 seconds
No. Taps:		1 - 16
Dry/Wet Mix:	0 - 1
