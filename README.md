SmuleFFmpeg is a test program integrating ffmpeg library, sound effect processing and audio toolbox playback

There should be nothing to setup except the developing team signature in Signing & Capabilities in Xcode

There are two targets iOS-Simulator and macOS working identically.

How to use the application:

1. Run the project and select one of the two files from the menu
2. Push the <Decode> button
3. Now you can play the file with the multi-tap delay effect as an audio filter
